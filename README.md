**Ladar is a tool designed to address a critical problem in software development:
managing API changes and automating the replacement of one library with another.**

Whether you're upgrading a library to a new version with breaking changes, **refactoring
your codebase, or migrating from one third-party library to another, Ladar simplifies
and automates the process**, reducing manual effort and **minimizing the risk of
errors**.

Additionally, **Ladar allows developers to create migration recipes, which can be shared
within the community to facilitate consistent and efficient transitions across
projects.**
